            <h2> Who is Tesla? Well, in short, the BEST EV company with autonomous driving capabilities </h2>
            <p>Tesla is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in California, USA. 
                Ranked as the <b> world’s most valuable EV maker </b>, Tesla is undoubtedly the market leader in the EV industry. 
                Obviously, Tesla is more than just an EV company - it is <em>also</em> a technology company exploring clean energy 
                and autonomous driving in a mission to accelerate the world’s transition into driving electric vehicles. </p>

            <p> Luckily for us, Tesla's Model S and Model X came to Ireland 
                in 2017. The only Tesla store and service centre is located in Sandyford, Dublin. There are 
                three Supercharger locations in Ireland with <b> further sites planned </b> 
                and over forty Destination Charging locations all over the country.</p>

            <h2>Why choose Tesla? </h2>

                <img class = 'car' src = "Tesla/MS.jpg" alt = "Tesla Model S">
                <img class = 'car' src = "Tesla/M3.png" alt = "Tesla Model 3">

            <p> As the Tesla model names suggest, the main reason why you should consider
                getting a Tesla is because they are <i> S 3 X Y </i> ;). Although the Irish government hasn't legalized the use of self-driving cars on our roads yet, these Tesla
                cars are still electric-powered, which can <em> reduce fuel costs</em> and <em>gas emissions</em>.
                Furthermore, there are tests being conducted for self-driving cars on Irish roads so 
                I believe self-driving cars will sooner or later be a normality in Ireland. 
                So why not invested into the future now?

        <section> <h2> How does autonomous driving work? </h2>
            
            <p> Tesla Model Y is the only Tesla car with <em> full self-driving capability </em> but sadly,
                as mentioned previously, the self-driving functions are still pending for approval of use :( <br>
                So how does a Tesla drive itself? The short answer is, many smart devices are compiled to work together to 
                create the safest self-driving car, as listed below: </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> A forward-facing radar provides a long-range view of up to 160 meters </li>
                    <li> 8 rear, side and forward-facing cameras with 360 degree view provide maximum visibility </li>
                    <li> A high-precision digitally-controlled electric assist braking system </li>
                    <li> 12 long-range ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby cars, prevent collisions, assist with parking and blind-spot monitoring </li>
                </ul>

        <div class = "cols"> 
                <figure>
                    <img src = "Tesla/autopilot.png" alt = "Image showing the range of visibility of cameras, radars and sensors on a Tesla vehicle">
                </figure>
                
                <p>The cameras, radars and sensors enable the car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane.
                    The sensors and cameras track the position of cars ahead in order to keep a safe distance, for example, 
                    if a car merges into your lane, the Tesla will adjust its position and reduce speed if necessary.  
                    The cameras also help to keep the Tesla centered by tracking the positioning of road markings. 
                    For the Tesla to change lanes, the driver manually indicates the turn signal, then the sensors prevent 
                    the Tesla from merging into other cars.
