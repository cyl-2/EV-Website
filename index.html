            <h2> What are electric vehicles? </h2>
            <p> Electric vehicles are powered by electricity, which <em>drastically reduces</em> fuel consumption for transportation. 
                By driving an electric powered vehicle, you are <em>reducing</em> the amount of harmful gases released into the atmosphere, 
                causing global climate change. Furthermore, you get to <em>save on costs</em>, as EVs are cheaper than petrol or diesel-fuelled 
                vehicles. <br>
                On top of that, the Irish government is set to <strong>ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2030</strong> in hopes to achieve our emission 
                targets. <a href ="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48668791" target="_blank">You can read more about the ban here</a>. With that said, 
                isn’t it smart to start looking for the next EV to purchase right now? <br>
                In this website, I have gathered some cool information about a few of my favorite EV companies and also a EV company 
                manufacturing buses. <a href = "#learn"> Click here to find out more.</a>

                <p> This video shows the inner workings and cool technologies of Tesla Model S, which is currently the world's <em>fastest 
                    accelerating car </em> and it's also <em>fully electric</em>! </p>

                <h2> Some Electric Vehicle Facts </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Most EVs have a <b>built-in sound</b> when they are moving at lower speeds. This <b>alerts pedestrians</b> to their presence. </li>
                    <li> There are <b>zero harmful gas emissions </b> produced from EVs. Transport accounts for one third of Ireland’s energy related
                        CO2 emissions, by switching to EVs, we can make a huge difference in our carbon footprint. </li>
                    <li> Evs are <b>cheaper to buy</b> as there are grants and reductions for every purchase of an EV. </li>
                    <li> EVs are at the <b>lowest tax band</b> for vehicle road tax (which is calculated on the emissions level of the vehicle), 
                        because EVs are zero-emission. </li>
                    <li> EVs are <b>cheaper to service</b> and there is less wear and tear as EVs don’t have engine oils and fewer moving parts. </li>
                    <li> EVs are <b>cheaper to fuel</b>, one can save as much as 70% on fuel costs! </li>
                    <li> A research done by the European Energy Agency found that, even with electricity generation, the <b> carbon emissions of an electric car are still 17 – 30% lower than driving a petrol or diesel car.</b> </li>
                    <li> The SEAI (Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland) offers <b>grants of up to €10, 000 on EVs</b> purchased and registered in Ireland.</li>
