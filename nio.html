            <h2> Nio, an EV gem </h2>
            <p> Nio is an amazing Chinese electric vehicle company based in Shanghai, China, founded by William Li in 2014, 
            who started the company to help provide a solution to decrease
            the pollution caused by gasoline vehicles in the crowded cities of China. <br>
            Today, Nio is the world’s <b> seventh-most-valuable EV car maker </b>, with very meaningful goals 
            and ambitions to change how the world transports on a daily basis, leading to a more sustainable, greener future.
            Nio has plans to debut their cars onto the European market within the next five years which I think
            is very exciting. </p>

            <h2> Nio’s name, a special meaning </h2>
            <p> Nio’s Chinese name, <i lang = "zh-Hans"> 蔚来 (pronounced as: Weilai) </i>, means Blue Sky Coming. A blue sky indicates a brighter, open minded future. 
            This message is also conveyed through Nio’s logo. </p>

                    Although Nio cars are not on the European market yet, they should <em> definitely </em> be on your watchlist.
                    Not only does Nio offer these very luxurious, beautiful cars that reduce your carbon footprint, 
                    Nio has an amazing plan for customers to ease their worries of maintaining a car - <i> Worry-Free Package</i>. 
                    Nio also has a competitive advantage over many other EV cars - <i>BaaS, Battery As A Service.</i> </p>

            <h2> Nio's Cool Services </h2>  
            
            <section> <h3> Nio, battery as a service (BaaS)</h3>
            <div class = "cols">
                <p> With <em>over</em> <b> 140 battery swap stations in over 60 cities </b> in China, 
                    Nio successfully launched BaaS in late August, 2020. </p>

                <figure> <img src = "Nio/map.jpg" alt = "Map of locations where Nio has charging stations in China"> 
                    <figcaption> Text translation: Nio has 143 battery swapping stations in 64 citiies <br>
                                Nio has 64 charging stations in 33 cities.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Seeing how BaaS was successfully implemented in many cities throughout China, I am excited to see Nio's 
                development in Europe in the near future. </p> 
         
            <h4> Main benefits of BaaS: </h4>
                <ul> 
                    <li> <b>Fully-automatic battery swap in just 3 minutes</b>. Compared to charging a vehicle, which takes more than 6 hours, Nio’s BaaS is clearly a better option.</li>
                    <li> <b>Electric system checks</b> during each swap to ensure the car and battery are at their best performance. 
                        This helps the customer to identify any issues with the car (if any) as soon as possible to prevent accidents. </li>
                    <li> BaaS <b>lowers the price of a new vehicle by around 20%</b> if you purchase a car with the service. </li>
                    <li> The customer <b>doesn’t have to worry about the cost of battery replacements</b> or reduced range as the battery ages </li>
                    <li> <b>Customers can use any battery pack based on their needs.</b> All Nio cars are built with the same battery trays so 
                        customers can avail of any battery pack with any Nio car. For example, a customer originally has the 70 kWh pack, 
                        the customer can also rent the 100 kWh battery if they want to. They just pay the 100 kWh pack lease cost for that 
                        month and swap it back when the month is over. Or if they want to continue to use it, they can just continue to pay 
                        the higher lease price </li>
                </ul> 
            </div>

            <section><h3> Nio, worry-case package</h3>
                <div class = "cols">   
                <p> This package is designed to make servicing your Nio vehicle <em>convenient and easy.</em> The initial NIO vehicle owner can enjoy 
                    free quality assurance, roadside assistance, and car connectivity services for the duration of the vehicle’s lifetime. </p>
